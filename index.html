		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<h2>Regal Disclaimer Software Development Services - "RD SDS"</h2>

		<p>RD SDS is more than a codeshop - we are software architects and engineers
			who deliver a rock-solid and efficient business solution using a suite of
			modern software development technologies.
		</p>

		<p>Traditional software development services offered by our competitors are
			made to require updates and troubleshooting. Their project workflow rely
			on a client-generated specification, to which poorly tested makeshift
			software is added on until requirements are met. This often leads to
			unnecessary and	inefficient code, as well as poor control over quality. 
			The process resembles tacking on bits of clay until the 'pot' is able to
			hold all the contents - and will often have issues with structural
			integrity and require maintenance.
		</p>
			
		<p>RD SDS offers something entirely different. Instead of going through the
			time consuming and expensive work of shaping clay around the contents,
			only to not be able to predict how strong the resulting structure is,
			RD SDS utilizes tested and industry proven tools to create a modular
			architecture, not only saving time and costs, but also requiring
			less maintenance.
		</p>

		<p>With RD SDS, Each client project begins with a general survey of the client's
			past solutions, current needs and future goals. From this survey, multiple
			blueprints are generated with information on the costs and benefits of each
			solution set. These solutions not only meet the client's needs and goals in
			an efficient manner, but also often correct and improve previously installed
			parts of the architecture. The result is a robust software architecture plan
			that improves the client's overall software stack, rather than merely adding
			on a module that does not work well with the rest of the infrastructure.
		</p>

		<p>After the client decides on a solution set that they are happy with, the
			software blueprint is turned into a software architecture built by tested
			and reliable tools. Thanks to our experience with modern tools, we are often
			able to offer our robust solutions at much lower price as well as faster
			time. Further, the disciplined architecture makes inspection and future
			upgrades inexpensive, manageable, and easy.
