		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<h2>Regal Disclaimer</h2>
		<h3>Technical Consulting</h3>
			<p>We are young experts with experience in new software technologies.</p>
			<p>We integrate seamlessly into your current team, providing guidance and resource as necessary. The team will become more mindful of security risks, develop a more robust product with higher performance.</p>
			<p>Give your team a boost without a dramatic increase to your payroll!</p>

		<h3>Product Development</h3>
			<p>We are product architects, and understand hardware, software, and users.</p>
			<p>We do more than writing code. We participate in designing the product in the ecosystem, giving us an understanding of your company's goals, as well as the product users' needs. This allows us to better design the product architecture with many moving parts: hardware, front-end framework, middleware, back-end logic, database structure, third-party packages, APIs, secure certificates, CDNs, backups, payment processing, and the list goes on...</p>
			<p>The product architecture that we design are highly modular, which make them easy to build and test. Easy building means lower costs, and easy test means robust and secure!</p>

		<h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
			<p>We are highly adaptive to your needs.</p>
			<p>Not all clients require the development of a full product architecture. For early business development and research, rapid prototyping is more appropriate.</p>
			<p>The Pareto principle (80/20 rule) will help you pioneer new products within short time and smaller costs. You can test the waters with the prototype, and make rapid changes to the project. Once you're happy with the direction, you can easily transition into full product development without losing valuable progress.</p>
			<p>Different jobs need different tools. Rapidly prototyping effectively requires specific tools that are not often used in traditional software development. Our knowledge and experience with prototyping tools makes us the perfect fit for your prototyping needs!</p>

		<h3>Contact Us</h3>
